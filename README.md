# Sujai Portfolio

Personal portfolio site built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

This repository showcases a personal brand experience focused on immersive visuals, polished front-end execution, and a portfolio structure that is easy to maintain, review, and deploy. It combines production-ready React code, reusable content modules, curated static assets, and supporting design references so collaborators can quickly understand both the final site and the creative process behind it.

## What Is In This Repo

- `src/`: application source code, routes, UI components, and content data.
- `public/`: static assets served directly by Vite.
- `assets/`: a curated archive of the site images and favicon used in the current build.
- `docs/deployment.md`: deployment notes for Vercel and other static hosts.
- `docs/reference-html/`: older HTML reference pages kept for comparison and inspiration.
- `docs/design-previews/`: desktop and mobile design screenshots for review.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: start the local Vite development server.
- `npm run build`: create a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint across the project.
